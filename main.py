# Part 0: Getting Ready
# Write a program that does the following in order:
# 1. Asks the user to enter a number “x”
# 2. Asks the user to enter a number “y”
# 3. Prints out number “x”, raised to the power “y”.
# 4. Prints out the log (base 2) of “x”.
#
# X = float(input("Please, enter the first no"))
# Y = float(input("Please, enter the Secound no"))
# print(X**Y)


#===================================
#Part A: House Hunting
#===================================


# annual_salary = float(input("Please, Enter your annual salary"))
# saving_rate = float(input("Please, Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal"))
# house_total_cost = float(input("Please, Enter the cost of your dream home"))
# portion_down_payment_rate  = float(input("Please, Enter the down payment rate"))
# house_cost_after_downpayment = house_total_cost - (house_total_cost * portion_down_payment_rate)
# month_salary = annual_salary / 12
# month_saving = month_salary * saving_rate
# number_of_monthes = house_cost_after_downpayment / month_saving
# print("Number of monthes: {}".format(number_of_monthes))

#Part B: Saving, with a raise
#===================================
